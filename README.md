# Speech Resource List

This reading list is mantained by [Ramon Sanabria](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ramons/), [Edinburgh NLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) and [The Centre for Speech Technology Research](http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/). Ex [Language Technologies Institute](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/) and [Robotics Institute] (https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), [CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/). 

This list is probably biased towards my current research directions. So, please, if there is anythin missing, please let me know. Suggestions are super welcome :)
